Combs 1965,"chinook, sockeye (wild)",egg survival,lab,WA (NE Cascades): Entiat River,maintained water temps w/in 1 C; recorded w thermistors,"multiple trials, each with one control; constant temperature treatment and variable temperature treatment (eggs first raised in 42.5F, then transferred at regular intervals (1-3 d) to 35F)",percent mortality vs. incubation temperature,"1957-8, 1959-60",
Murray and McPhail 1987,"chinook, coho, sockeye, chum, pink (wild)",egg survival,lab,"BC: Babine R, Rosewall Cr, Weaver Cr, and Chilliwack R","eggs separated into lots, adjusted to experimental temperature over 4h, then reared at 5 controlled temperatures; conditions well-aerated, temperatures recorded daily; mortality assessed daily",each species at 5 constant temperatures,"survival, growth, and time to emergence (latter two as # days to 50% hatching and emergence) vs. temperature",does not specify,"survivals might be a bit low, compared to other studies -- possibly because eggs were all from same family (less genetic variation); differences in egg size may account for different emergence timing among populations; suggest maximum conversion of yolk to tissue at 2 C (coho), 2-5 C (sockeye, 5-8 (other species); populations adapted to local temperature regimes and spawn timing"
Olson and Foster 1955,chinook (wild),egg survival,lab,WA (E): Columbia River near Priest Rapids,eggs collected in field and transported to lab,"control = seasonal trend similar to river (for 1946-1952); treatments were -3.6, +2, +4, and +8 degrees F below/above river trend",percent mortality and growth vs. incubation temperature,10/26/1953 - 5/5/1954,trying to get the Olson et al. 1970 original paper (data transcribed by Bergendorf included here)
Beacham and Murray 1985,chum (wild),egg survival,lab,BC: Ninitat River,eggs collected in field from 5 families and transported to lab; study investigated effects of female body length on egg/alevin survival and egg size on alevin/fry size; checked daily for mortality/emergence,"3 temperatures (4, 8, 12 C), eggs from 3 age classes of females ",survival and growth vs. incubation temperature,30621,"egg weight & diameter were dependent on female body size (paper has table of data, not included here)"
Jensen and Groot 1991,chinook (hatchery),egg survival,lab,BC: Big Qualicum hatchery,"water temperature initially 10C; 30 eggs per group, 2 groups per treatment, in incubation baskets in either experimental flood-type moist air incubators or directly into test water; tanks 40-L and well-aerated","20 treatments: 2 replicates each; water temperatures @ constant10,12,14,16,18, 20 C for upper lethal temperature tests; also tested exposure to water vs. moist air at 4 levels of flooding (%): 100, 8.3, 4.2, 2.1",survival vs. constant temperatures,not stated,only reporting values for 100% water immersion here; analysis that included water immersion effects showed that there is good survival below 14C in any moist air/water conditions
Homolka and Downey 1995,spring chinook (hatchery; wild),egg survival,field obs; field expt,OR: upper McKenzie R,studied biological characteristics of salmon in relation to water temperature changes associated with 2 dams,"field study: adult, redd, and emergent fry surveys (wild fish) and temp. loggers; field expt: artificial egg incubators used to determine emergence timing in relation to temperature (hatchery fish): 300 fertilized eggs",emergence timing vs. stream temperature,8/92 to 4/93; field expt began 9/28/92,not all artificial incubators were recovered; those at Finn Rock site miscalculated thermal exposure; thus gained only limited information from these tests
Crisp 1992,brown trout,fry survival,review,n/a,"no experimental data; trying to come up with ""ready reckoners"", presumably for aquaculture",calculated expected values based on equations from Elliott 1984 (cited within),survival (time to 50% and 100% mortality) vs. temperature,n/a,
Raleigh et al. 1986,chinook,egg & juvenile survival,model,n/a,model that can be parameterized for specific location; inputs and outputs in format of suitability index curves; temperature is one of many factors considered,not an experiment; fish sizes not given,suitability index (0 to 1): optimal temperatures by life stage,n/a,"values used in the curves are based on judgment, information derived from the literature, and field data"
Konecki et al. 1995,coho (wild),fry survival,lab,"WA: tribs to Chehalis R, Solduc R, and Discovery Bay (Straight of Juan de Fuca), WA",tested whether differences in critical thermal maxima were due to genetics (fish from 3 populations) or acclimation regimes (answer = the latter); fish collected streamside and put in stream water which was gradually increased (1 C per minute) until death; lab tests followed similar procedure with fish held in artificial streams for 2 months prior,"mean stream water temperatures: Bingham Cr = 11.5 C, Bockman Cr = 16.6 C, and Snow Cr = 14.6 C; mean artificial stream temperature = 11 C",critical thermal maxima (temperature at which fish loses equilibrium and would die),field tests: 8/19/91 to 9/26/91 (10:00 to 18:30); lab tests: 1/24/92 to 2/4/92,
