Coutant 1970,"coho, steelhead, chinook (wild)",adult (jack chinook) survival,lab,WA (E): Columbia River near Priest Rapids,"transport, holding, and experiment conditions: river water, well-aerated, constant temperatures, uncrowded; acclimated (up to 21d) at river temperatures before test",control fish (river temperatures) held for 1 wk; test fish observed at 2 hr intervals,loss of equilibrium and death vs. temperature,1967-1969,"study conducted over 3-yr period due to logistical constraints, thus acclimation temperatures varied widely; final graph provides comparison between adult and juvenile times to death (juvenile data not provided here)"
Mesa et al. 2002,fall chinook (wild),juvenile survival,lab,"Hanford Reach, Columbia R","exposed fish to 4 temperature profiles similar to pools in Hanford Reach; tested for direct mortality, predation by smallmouth bass, and physiological stress; tanks well-aerated, 104L, densities ~ 0.28 g/L, acclimated for 2 d; initial length of fish used averaged 38.4 + 0.6 mm, and weight averaged 0.7 + 0.1 g; fed 3-4% daily ration","direct mortality: 4 groups of 20 fish; 2 treatment (heated) tanks (replicates), 2 control (12 C constant)",survival,April & May 1998-9,"results: no effect of thermal stress on direct mortality or vulnerability to predation, but increased physiological stress"
Nebeker et al. 1979,"steelhead, chinook, coho, sockeye (hatchery)",juvenile survival,lab,n/a,"fish raised from eggs, tested for survival at several constant temperatures and air saturation levels; steelhead tested at 15 months of age (smolts); tested under natural photoperiod; mean size ranges (depended on age and time of year tested): steelhead 5.8 g (7.9 cm) to 40.5 g (16.2 cm), chinook 23.8 g (12.6 cm) to 95.8 g (20.6 cm), sockeye 6.6 g (8.4 cm) to 111.5 g (20.9 cm), and coho 20.5 g (11.9 cm) to 51.6 g (16.7 cm) ","constant water temperatures of 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 20 C; and air supersaturation concentrations of 115, 116, 117, 118, and 120%",survival (time to 50% and 20% death) vs. temperature & air saturation level,n/a,
Brett 1952,"chinook, pink, sockeye, chum, coho (hatchery)",juvenile survival,lab,n/a,"acclimated at a series of non-lethal temperatures then subjected to high or low constant temperatures to test for tolerance (different acclimation temperatures arrived at over 1 to 4 weeks); mean lengths, weights, and ages given with data","acclimation temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, 23 C (holding trough temperatures 8.8 C) 5 replicates per test",time to death (resistance times),1949-50,
Hokanson et al. 1977,rainbow trout (hatchery),juvenile survival,lab,Midwest: Lake Superior,experiment investigated growth and mortality at constant and diel fluctuating temperatures; developed yield model - response to fluctuating temperatures shift to 1.5 C colder than constant response; evidence that rainbows acclimate to a value between mean and max in fluctuating temps,"7 constant temperatures between 8 and 22 C and 6 fluctuating temperatures 12 to 22 +/- 3.8 C (fluctuations followed sine curve pattern, minimum at 0400 and maximum at 1600 CDT), 50 d duration",survival and growth vs. temperature,26420,mortality data but not growth data recorded here (similar patterns in growth among constant vs. fluctuating temperatures); upper incipient lethal determined to be 25.6 (acclimated at 16 C).
Thomas et al. 1986,coho (hatchery),juvenile survival,lab,Alaska,"experiment investigated effect of fluctuating and constant temperature regimes on mortality, stress, and energy reserves; fish held in natural daylight diel cycles and adequate water quality conditions; growth tests on age-0 and physiology tests on age-2 fish; mortality tests used both age classes","temperature ranges: (1) 10-13 C (simulating forested stream), (2) 9-15 C (simulating average clearcut), (3) 8-17 C (clearcut), (4) 6.5-20 C (clearcut), and control of constant 11 C; tests for unacclimated and acclimated (2 C per 2 day increase or 1 C per 2 day decrease) fish","survival, growth, stress levels (physiology)","simulated summer conditions, year not stated","results recorded here for direct mortality and growth, not physiology; also presents several graphs of results of physiological stress; fluctuating temperatures did not affect growth of age-0 fish within any ration group but evidence in plasma cortisol levels of age-2 fish appeared after 9 days and increased to 25-50% higher by day 19"

Hughes et al. 1978,"coho, steelhead (hatchery)",juvenile survival,field expt,Western Oregon,"outdoor model streams mimicking natural conditions used to investigate effects of increasing temperatures on consumption, growth, and survival",control stream followed natural temperature regime (weekly temperature from 3 C in winter to 16 C in summer) and treatment stream was heated (7 to 19 C); effect was that heated stream was ~3-4 C warmer than control,growth,1968-1977,"research presented here mostly from 1975-77 and previous work (lab studies) summarized: increased temperatures reduced feeding, growth, and survival; survival of eggs and fry through time is graphed and decreases through time, but is highly confounded with factors other than temperature (e.g., substrate, % fines, competition), and results are not recorded here; growth rates may also be confounded by interspecific competition; canonical analyses suggest that elevation of temperature has a greater disruptive effect on coho than on steelhead"
Brett et al. 1982,chinook (wild & hatchery),juvenile survival,lab (and field),BC: Nechako and Big Qualicum rivers,tested effect of temperature on growth and survival,"Nechako fish: 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 w/ replicates at 20, 22, and 24 C (10 tanks total); Big Qualicum fish: 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 w/ replicates at 20, 22, and 24 (13 tanks total)",growth and survival,~1980,"based on this experiment and a sockeye growth model, the expected optimum for growth in Nechako at 60% of maximum daily intake ration is 14.8 C; sublethal stress (20% less growth than optimum) at 18-19 C, and no growth possible at this feeding level at 21.4 C"
Beacham and Withler 1991,chinook (wild & hatchery),juvenile survival,lab,BC: Vancouver Island & Skeena R basin,test whether there is a genetic difference in ability of juvenile fish to survive high temperatures,"4 replicates for Bear R fish and 1 for Robertson Cr fish, with 1 control tank for each (ambient temperatures); control tanks were subsequently tested too; test temperatures of ~20 to 22.5 C",survival and time to death,32690,"southern population died later than northern population, but none of variation attributable to genetics; larger fish survived better than smaller fish, and a negative genetic correlation between body weight and survival existed"
